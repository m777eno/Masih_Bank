Masih Bank is a program created by Enoch Masih to fulfill the requirements on the final project of the class CIS-153. 
This program is a data analyzer. 
The purpose of Masih Bank is to educate the user on better financial practices by simulating a bank account.
The program is composed of a file containing the program code written in python and a text file named, "Ledger.txt".
The program uses the text file as an account book for a simulated bank account created by the program.
When the program is executed, the user would be presented a welcome screen which asks the user to either create an account or login to an account. 
Depending on the selection of the user; the program will then either search for a login in the ledger or write a new user account in the ledger.
Once logged in, the user is brought to the main menu of the program where the user is free to explore different options.
These options consists of: Checking, Savings, Transfer, Loans, Good banker, references, and logout.
Checking and Savings options allow the user to add or remove funds from their respective account while also educating the user on smarter money habits.
Transfer option transfers funds between checking and savings.
Loans not only educates but also includes a loan calculator.
In the loan calculator the user can calculate their monthly payment based on a fixed monthly payment.
This analyzes the data of the savings account while educating the user on loan practices.
Good banker is a collection of all advice.
References provides cited sources of all advice provided in the program.
logout will bring the user back to the welcome screen.
